# Grocery Management Tool with Recipe Integration

## Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive tool for managing groceries, integrating recipes, and tracking nutrition. It analyzes current inventory, helps with grocery list creation for meal prep, and provides nutritional information, including macronutrient counts. The tool also suggests recipes based on what ingredients users have on hand.

## Features
- **User Account Creation and Login**: Secure user authentication to access and manage personal data.
- **Grocery Inventory Management**: Functionality to add/remove items, and track quantity and expiration dates.
- **Recipe Suggestion**: Recipe recommendations based on the user's current inventory.
- **Nutritional Information Display**: Macronutrient and calorie counts for each recipe.
- **Grocery List Generation**: Automated generation of shopping lists based on recipe selection or inventory needs.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 
- npm (or yarn)

## Roadmap
- Week 1-2: Project setup and MVP definition.
- Week 3-4: Core feature development.
- Week 5: Macro breakdown implementation and feature enhancements.
- Week 6: Testing, bug fixes, and deployment.
